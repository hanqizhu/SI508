This assignment is quite simple: the content is just what I learn from the textbook basics.
1. I think iteration and string slicing are useful, which are also different from what I learned in C++ language.
2. Other basic programming logics in python are similar to other high level languages, so I started quite easily. Maybe I will find more differences as I go on studying python :)
