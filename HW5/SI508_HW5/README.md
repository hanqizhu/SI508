# SI508_HW5 Hanqi Zhu

This is an assignment about a simple card game, the rules of which are written in the code_description_SI508_assignment5.txt file.

The SI508_cards.py file is the original file given by the instructors.

The SI508_assignment5_tests.py file is what I written as the test cases for this assignment. 

There are 7 problems with 18 tests in this file, to briefly introduce:

    Problem1 tests the initialization of the Card class.
	
    Problem2 tests the initialization of the Deck class.
	
    Problem3 tests the shuffle of the Deck class.
	
    Problem4 tests the pop_card and replace_card functions of the Deck class.
	
    Problem5 tests the deal_hand function of the Deck class.
	
    Problem6 tests the sort_card function of the Deck class.
	
    Problem7 tests the invoking of the play_war_game function.
  
I also tried to debug the original file of SI508_cards.py, and uploaded my version in the Possible_Solutions.py file.

Take a look if you would like to.
